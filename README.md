#Typescript Notes
Learning TypeScript from a variety of online tutorials. 

___
##Questions I have, and curiosities that come about
* Why is this better than Babel?
* Why is static typing so important?
* What do they mean by 'powerful typing features'?
	- **what is so complicated about data typing?**
	- **why are there entire books and courses on type coercion?**
* Since ES6 is valid TypeScript, how much do I need to worry about all the class and type stuff? Since I'm not an object-oriented programmer, is it okay to just write ES6 in a `.ts` file and that's that?

##Why TypeScript?
Adds interfaces, abstract classes, algebraic data types, and other features to JavaScript, which we wouldn't be able to use otherwise. Makes it more like OOP that a lot of developers are more comfortable with.

Angular 2's codebase is written in TypeScript. It's support from Microsoft and Google means it's pretty legit.


###New Features
* Classes
* Interfaces
* Compile-time type checks


With very few exceptions, vanilla ES6 is perfectly valid TypeScript. That makes it much more accessible than other compile-to-JS languages.

Do I need to learn object-oriented programming **before**. Since I don't come from that background, I have no desire to make classes out of everything. And I started learning JavaScript from Kyle Simpsons courses that warn against it.
