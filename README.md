##Why TypeScript?
Adds interfaces, abstract classes, algebraic data types, and other features to JavaScript, which we wouldn't be able to use otherwise. Makes it more like OOP that a lot of developers are more comfortable with.

* Classes
* Interfaces
* Compile-time type checks

With very few exceptions, vanilla ES6 is perfectly valid TypeScript. That makes it much more accessible than other compile-to-JS languages.
